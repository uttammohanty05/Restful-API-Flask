        "Ans:- In Flask, error handling is a crucial part of building robust applications, ensuring that the application responds appropriately to unexpected conditions. Flask provides several ways to handle errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Error Handlers**: Flask allows you to define custom error handlers for specific HTTP error codes (e.g., 404 for \"Not Found\", 500 for \"Internal Server Error\"). By using the `@app.errorhandler()` decorator, you can catch errors globally and provide custom responses, such as a friendly error message or a redirect.\n",

This is useful when a specific condition in the application isn't met (e.g., invalid input or unauthorized access). When an error is raised, Flask will automatically trigger the relevant error handler.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Custom Error Responses**: Flask supports returning custom error messages, often in formats like JSON, which is especially useful for APIs. This allows you to provide detailed information about what went wrong, such as the error type and the reason, helping clients to understand the issue better.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. **Install SQLAlchemy**: First, you install SQLAlchemy or a database-specific connector (such as `flask-sqlalchemy`) to enable Flask to communicate with the SQL database.\n",
